CPU-Scheduler
==============

Intro
------

 This Project demonstrates how the cpu scheduling works using algorithms:

        1- First Come First Served
        2- Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)
        2- Shortest Job First (Preemptive)
        3- Priority (Non-Preemptive)
        4- Priority (Preemptive)
        5- Round Robin

Contents
--------
- CPU Scheduler.exe : an executable file of the scheduler which requires input data and genetrates the Gantt chart of the processes
                     with their average waiting time and average turn around time                     
- Form1.cs : this file contains the backend of the project with all the algorithms' implementations 
- Chart.cs : this file is just a new form where the chart is being created
- Tips.cs : this file is just a new form which shows how to use the program
